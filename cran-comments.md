## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a URL to the Socrata Open Data API website in my Description field.
* Put single quotes around 'Socrata Open Data API' and 'SoQL' to indicate that these are external services, and not normal English words.

## Test environment

* Tested and built on Windows 7, R 3.2.3.
* Tested on Travis CI.
* Tested on win-builder: R 3.2.3 and R-devel.

## R CMD check results

There are no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There is one NOTE:
